# Welcome

Well hello, it's me, S0m3_random_guy! (You probably never heard of me)
I am a learner and I just started to code.
Maybe you're like me, and just starting and maybe you're a pro.
But enough of this nonsense, let's see what is this project about.

## About this project

I bet you heard of Xbox. If not, Xbox is a gaming console first presented (I think) 2000. year, created by Microsoft corporation, in order to compete with the dominating Playstation 2. Xbox, even tho a sucess, couldn't even match Playstation in any aspect, until the release of Xbox one, the hit gaming console. Playtation is still the #1 (and will forever be), but in honor to Microsoft for creating Makecode Arcade (and all other makecodes), I have decided to create a Xbox One console inside of Makecode arcade. The idea of this project was to create a gaming console with a Makecode dev community to create games for this project :) For now, let's call it Mbox
